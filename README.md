# Image-Colouizer---FPGA-Project
FPGA-based image colourizer with SystemVerilog RTL and UART streaming

## Overview
Multi-module FPGA-based image colourizer that reads grayscale image data 
BRAM, computes weighted RGB colour components from user input, and streams 
pixel data to host over UART.

## Design Principles
- System-level RTL Architecture
- FSM-Controlled dataflow
- Backpressure and flow control
- Hardware validation on FPGA

## Architecture
(add block diagram)

## Design/Implementation Tools
- SystemVerilog
- Vivado
- ILA
- Teraterm
